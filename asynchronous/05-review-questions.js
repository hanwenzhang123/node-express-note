This approach to asynchronous programming provides a then() method that you can use to chain together a series of asynchronous functions:
promises

This approach to asynchronous programming allows you to specify when JavaScript should wait for a function to return a result before moving on to the next line of code.
async/await

This approach to asynchronous programming uses nested functions to ensure asynchronous tasks are handled in the desired order:
callback

What is an example of an asynchronous task?
Requesting information from a database

The await keyword can not be used inside of any regular JavaScript function
The await keyword must be used inside of a function flagged async

What is a potential pitfall of using callbacks to handle asynchronous tasks?
many nested functions can cause a pyramid of doom which can make the logic difficult to foolow
